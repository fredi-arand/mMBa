# Modified Maximal Ball Algorithm (mMBa)

Algorithm which was used for my
[PhD thesis](https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/26476/).
It is a slightly improved version of the algorithm presented in
[Computers & Geosciences](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300416305180).

Being a physicist, I had to learn programming, so excuse the mess ðŸ˜‰

## First steps

Typically, you might want to "see something". In order to do so, download the
[Berea sandstone](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/earth-science/research/research-groups/pore-scale-modelling/micro-ct-images-and-networks/berea-sandstone/)
sample and put `Berea.raw` into this directory.

Next, have a look at `demo.sh` (and maybe `src/main.cpp`). If you think that it
will probably work out, run

```
./demo.sh
```
